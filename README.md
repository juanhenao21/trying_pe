# Project Euler and Me

These are the implementations to get the solutions of the problems of the [Project Euler Website](https://projecteuler.net).
This repository is made to have a control of what I have done with the problems and I do not recommend to see the implementations. They are two main reasons

1. They are my Python implementation to find the solution, so probably there will not be something really oustanding.
2. The idea behind Project Euler is to find out the solution by yourself, so do not cheat with these implementations.

In each file is the description of the problem, my implementation to find the solution and the suggested answer provided by Project Euler and implemented
in Python by me.

Wish me good luck!
