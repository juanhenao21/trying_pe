# Project Euler and Me

These are the implementations to get the solutions of the problems of the [Project Euler Website](https://projecteuler.net).
This repository is made to have a control of what I have done with the problems and I do not recommend to see the implementations. They are two main reasons

1. They are really basic as my python level is low (I am using Python evidently).
2. The idea behind Project Euler is to find out the solution by yourself, so do not cheat with this awful implementations.

Wish me good luck!
